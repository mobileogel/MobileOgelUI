### This is the machine learning repo for the Mobile Ogel Application. Training pipelines, inference tests, and data augmentation scripts will be in here
Carleton FYP Capstone 23-24

This project aims to revolutionize the Lego building experience by leveraging machine learning and computer vision technology. Built with a trained YOLOv5 model integrated into a Swift mobile app using Core ML, MobileOgel will accurately identify and inventory various Lego pieces through the camera of the userâ€™s device. The application will analyze the detected pieces and generate tailored building instructions of different Lego models the user can build with their existing pieces.  

The driving force behind this project is to address the challenges Lego enthusiasts and educators often face when they have remaining Lego pieces from previous sets and do not know what to do with them. With a blend of innovation and nostalgia, this application aims to provide alternative build suggestions, reduce the amount of Lego wastage, and enhance the overall user experience.
